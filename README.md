## Introduction
In the digital age, ensuring the security and confidentiality of sensitive information has become paramount. This article presents the development of a web application that offers users the ability to encrypt their text or files using the venerable "Atbash" encryption method. This method provides a straightforward yet effective approach to secure data transmission.

## Task Overview
The primary objective is to create a user-friendly web application that enables individuals to encrypt and decrypt their text or files effortlessly. The application will support various input methods, including clipboard integration, keyboard input, and file uploads, while producing encrypted outputs in the form of files or text.

## Functionalities and Requirements
The web application aims to cater to a broad audience with varying encryption needs. It encompasses the following key features:

 ## 2.1. Encryption and Decryption
Users can easily encrypt their text or files using the Atbash encryption method. This process involves the substitution of letters in a manner that ensures the confidentiality of the original content.

 ## 2.2. User-Friendly Interface
The application boasts an intuitive user interface, making it accessible to individuals with diverse technical backgrounds. The encryption and decryption processes are streamlined to require minimal user input and effort.


 ## 2.3. Mitigating Multiple Requests
Recognizing the importance of security and system stability, the application is designed to handle and mitigate multiple requests effectively. This safeguard prevents potential misuse and helps maintain optimal performance.

The Atbash Encryption. Method At the core of this web application lies the time-tested Atbash encryption method. By substituting each letter with another at a specific position within the alphabet, the method obfuscates the original content. This approach, while simple, offers a level of protection suitable for a wide range of use cases.
